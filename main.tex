\opening{To Whom It May Concern,}
I am pleased to recommend dr. Ruslan Shaiakhmetov for the SPACERAISE Summer Doctoral School program.
%
As his PhD supervisor at the University of Bologna,
I have observed his progress in research and his commitment to advancing his knowledge and skills in computer science and engineering.

Ruslan’s current work focuses on the development of a digital twin for a racing car in collaboration with Dallara Automobili.
His research demonstrates his ability to tackle technically complex projects that combine robotics,
simulation, and artificial intelligence.
%
His contributions so far have been thorough and well-thought-out, particularly in the area of creating a virtual racer powered by AI.

He is motivated to expand his expertise further, particularly in applying artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems.
%
I believe the SPACERAISE program would be an excellent fit for him,
as it aligns well with his research focus.
%
The hands-on and collaborative aspects of the program will provide Ruslan with valuable insights and experiences that will contribute to his development as a researcher.

I am confident that Ruslan's participation in the program will be beneficial for both him and his peers.
%
He approaches his work with dedication and is always willing to learn from others,
which makes him a valuable member of any academic or professional setting.

Please feel free to contact me if you need any additional information.
