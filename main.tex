\opening{To Whom It May Concern,}
I am pleased to recommend dr. Davide Domini for the SPACERAISE Summer Doctoral School program.
%
As his PhD supervisor at the University of Bologna,
I have observed his progress in research and his commitment to advancing his knowledge and skills in computer science and engineering.

Davide's current work focuses on Collective Artificial Intelligence with a focus on Federated Learning and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
His research demonstrates his ability to tackle technically complex projects that combine advanced programming paradigms (e.g., Aggregate Computing),
simulation, and artificial intelligence.
%

He is motivated to expand his expertise further, particularly in applying artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems.
%
I believe the SPACERAISE program would be an excellent fit for him,
as it aligns well with his research focus.
%
The hands-on and collaborative aspects of the program will provide Davide with valuable insights and experiences that will contribute to his development as a researcher.

I am confident that Davide's participation in the program will be beneficial for both him and his peers.
%
He approaches his work with dedication and is always willing to learn from others,
which makes him a valuable member of any academic or professional setting.

Please feel free to contact me if you need any additional information.
